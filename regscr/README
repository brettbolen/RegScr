This application parses scripts and updates registers based on 
symbolic names.  A 'dictionary' file is read at startup containg
names of base addresses and offsets.  The script parses commands
such as 'Read', 'Write', 'Dump', and 'Print'.  When Reading
and Writing to Memory, the command takes the following form:

	Read	DEVICE_ADDR   OFFSET
or
	Write   DEVICE_ADDR   OFFSET  VALUE


todo:
	redo parsing, add commas, 

this is master branch.
